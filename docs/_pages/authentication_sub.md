### Introduction

Please consider federating with GAâ€™s single sign on solution as a lot of these requirements will be managed for you. Just have a chat with the Integration team.

### Lifecycle

Ensure that when employment ceases, processes exist so that accounts and privileged access relating to the position can be terminated or transferred, preferably automatically.

### Compromised

Consider an appropriate strategy for compromised accounts including immediate password replacement or account suspension.

### Service Accounts

Use service accounts where possible instead of user accounts and store administrative passwords appropriately within applications

### Security
