### Digital Service Standard

Follow as closely as possible the DTA's [Digital Service Standard](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/).

This covers criteria like:

#### Open Source

Open source by default. We want to keep our code as open as possible - for peer-review and transparency, and in order to contribute to the wider community.

#### Agile

Develop your stuff iteratively with as much user input as possible. Get a minimum viable product to your users as soon as possible.

#### Security

Bake in [Security](aws_security_sub.html)  as early as you can. Security is an essential ingredient, not a band-aid.

Make use of the passive security provided by some of the [Tools](tools_index.md) created by your GA teammates.

#### Testing

Make sure your services are tested from end-to-end.

### Efficiency

Build for efficiency. Don't design a wasteful architecture with unnecessary human interaction, pointless duplication, or over-allocated resources.

### Toolset

Developers are welcome to choose their own tools. If you don't know what to choose, talk to other teams. They'll point you in the direction of tools that we have a lot of experience with in the organisation. That way, you can be sure of getting help if you hit problems. Some examples might be:

* Python or Javascript
* AWS
* Pipelines or Travis

If you want to experiment with something different, go for it. If you suspect the project might make its way into production, though, you might want to check in with some other developers first. They'll give you good feedback about whether or not the tools you're using are likely to be supportable, scalable, and reliable enough for a production system.

### In short...

Think of the big picture. Take supportability and security into account. Do the best for GA. Make something awesome.
