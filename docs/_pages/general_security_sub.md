### ISM

Have a read of the [Australian Government Information Security Manual](http://www.asd.gov.au/publications/Information_Security_Manual_2016_Controls.pdf) (pdf). Especially useful are the top 4 strategies:

1. Application whitelisting
2. Patch applications
3. Patch operating systems
4. Restrict administrative privileges.
