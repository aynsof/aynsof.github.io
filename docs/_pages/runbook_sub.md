If you're running a production system, you should include a runbook in your repository alongside your application code and infrastructure code. This ensures that it is stored and version-controlled alongside the application it describes.

An example runbook is located [here](https://bitbucket.org/geoscienceaustralia/webserver-efs-db/wiki/Home).
