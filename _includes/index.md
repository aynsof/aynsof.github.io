# cloud.ga.gov.au
cloud.ga.gov.au is the repository for patterns and guides for teams across Geoscience Australia. Our guides are open source, and you're free to use them as you wish. Our hope is that other digital service teams — both inside and outside the government — will adopt or modify the practices outlined here.

By developing this material in the open, we hope to encourage expert review and contributions from across GA, ensuring that the information is current and relevant to all users.
