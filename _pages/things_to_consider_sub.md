### Before you begin

1. Join [Slack](https://join.slack.com/geoscience-australia/signup), our messaging app, using your ga.gov.au email address. It's a great place to ask questions.
2. Join the #awscop and #autobots channels to chat with experts from across GA.

### Learning about AWS\*

If you just want to experiment with AWS, you should get an account in the AWS Dev space. Send a Slack message or an email to the Autobots to get the ball rolling.

Remember to:

 * Tag your instances
 * Use small instance types wherever possible
 * Destroy your instances
 * Keep it secure
 * Expect your resources will be destroyed at any time

### Ongoing management

Each AWS space owner is responsible for ongoing management of their AWS space. This includes:

 * [Security](https://sec.gadevs.ga)
 * [Monitoring](https://monitor.gadevs.ga)
 * [Costs](setting_up_cost_monitoring.html)

### Migrating applications

Migrating of existing applications to AWS isn't as simple as copying and pasting existing on-premises infrastructure. Application owners will need to work with advice from the Autobots and other MDTs to create resilient cloud infrastructure. This can be helped by some of the [Tools](tools_index.html) that have been developed at GA.

### Choosing a cloud provider

There are a number of cloud providers available. Have a chat with the Autobots team, GA's architects, and MDTs that have already deployed cloud-based applications. They can help you make the best decision for your application.
