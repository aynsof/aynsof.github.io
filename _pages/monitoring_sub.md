### Internal monitoring

Use a tool like [MonitorGA](https://monitor.gadevs.ga) to monitor resources (CPU, memory, network, etc.) for your applications.

### External monitoring

Use a tool like [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) to ensure your site is available from outside GA, and to alert you of any downtime.

### Logging

Use a tool like [ELK](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/metrics) to perform analytics on logs.
